# Fall-Detection-Project

A leading cause of physical injury sustained by elderly persons is the event of unintentionally falling onto a hard surface. Approximately 32-42% of those 70 and over fall at least once each year, and those who live in assisted living facilities fall with greater frequency per year than those who live in residential communities. The project examines Fall data for binary classification, and investigates the best places for sensor location as well as the best model for classification.
